### BUG-001: Missing kind field on StabilityFitRecord blocks CFD-in-loop graduation

severity: critical
category: claim_gate
status: open
surface: kayakgen/eval/stability/
discovered: 2026-05-29 tick-1
claim: RFC 0058 defers the `kind` discriminator field to a successor RFC, but `cfd_in_loop_evaluator_status` requires records to carry `kind` to determine graduation eligibility, causing all fits without the field to be silently rejected.
evidence:
- kayakgen/eval/stability/accepted_fit.py:105-123 - StabilityFitRecord has no `kind` field
- kayakgen/services/generative_jobs.py:86-90 - cfd_in_loop_evaluator_status checks `getattr(record, "kind", None)` expecting "analytical" or "cfd_in_loop"
- docs/rfcs/0058-stability-calibration-acceptance.md:331-336 - Q5 explicitly defers `kind` discriminator to successor RFC
- tests/test_cfd_in_loop_evaluator_status.py:21-30 - tests use SimpleNamespace with `kind` field, never test actual StabilityFitRecord instances
impact: When RFC 0058 stage 4 promotes the first real StabilityFitRecord, `cfd_in_loop_evaluator_status` will always return "opt_in_only" because no promoted fit can declare its kind. CFD-in-loop evaluator will remain permanently behind the explicit acknowledgement gate despite the fit record technically satisfying the analytical-path requirement.
recommended_action: Either (1) add `kind` field to StabilityFitRecord now with a default or required discriminator, or (2) defer `cfd_in_loop_evaluator_status` landing to the successor RFC that formally introduces the `kind` field, or (3) redesign the check to not require the `kind` field and instead rely solely on structural presence of required scope fields.

### BUG-002: StabilityFixturePromotionPacket lacks validator for constrained-trace fixtures

severity: high
category: implementation_gap
status: open
surface: kayakgen/eval/stability/
discovered: 2026-05-29 tick-1
claim: RFC 0058 requires promotion packets to refuse fixtures with constrained trim/heave at validation time, but the validator is not implemented.
evidence:
- kayakgen/eval/stability/accepted_fit.py:205-231 - StabilityFixturePromotionPacket validator only checks review verdicts, rig_design_match, and rejection_reasons
- docs/rfcs/0058-stability-calibration-acceptance.md:246-248 - "A packet that promotes a fixture whose FreeEquilibriumTrace has constrained_trim or constrained_heave is refused at validate time"
- kayakgen/eval/stability/measured_fixture.py:295-307 - MeasuredStabilityFixture already enforces this constraint; promotion packet should mirror it
impact: An operator can construct a StabilityFixturePromotionPacket that promotes a fixture with constrained trim/heave to "measured_stability_fixture", violating the RFC contract that such fixtures cannot promote beyond "validation_candidate" state.
recommended_action: Add a model_validator to StabilityFixturePromotionPacket that loads the cited fixture via FixtureRef, checks FreeEquilibriumTrace.constrained_trim and .constrained_heave, and raises ValueError if promotion_target=="measured_stability_fixture" and either flag is true.
